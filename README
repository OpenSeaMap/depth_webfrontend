Synopsis
--------

Web frontend for the depth project (http://depth.openseamap.org).


Installation
------------

The Python build tool 'Waf' is used to build this repository. The
following tools are required:

  * Python (http://www.python.org/)
  * Closure-Compiler (https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/)
    (works with version 20120403)
  * Handlebars (http://handlebarsjs.com/precompilation.html)
    (works with version 1.0.12)

To build this project execute the following commands:

  > ./waf configure
  > ./waf build_debug && ./waf install_debug

The install command will copy all necessary files into the folder
'./debug'. To test your developments point your favourite web
server to this directory.


Tests
-----

Actually, we have no tests for the frontend. Feel free to create
some (e.g. Selenium).
